Hello everyone, 
 
Since my YouTube channel at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I7a2wBrGd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I7a2wBrGd8) was officially blocked for unknown reasons, I am unable to share the video tutorials with you about Flash USDT. I will provide more detailed information on GitHub at [flashtoken-usdt](https://github.com/Eric-KIein/Flash-USDT). Please follow my GitHub and related contract code for updates. 
 
Thank you!
